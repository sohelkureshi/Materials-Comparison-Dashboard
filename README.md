# Materials Comparison Dashboard

The **Materials Comparison Dashboard** is a web-based application designed to help users compare different materials based on various properties, such as load-bearing capacity, cost, weathering resistance, fire resistance, durability, sustainability, aesthetics, and workability. The dashboard presents these comparisons visually using an interactive chart and data table, allowing users to easily analyze and make decisions on material choices.

## Features

- **Interactive Material Comparison**: Select a property (e.g., load-bearing capacity, cost, etc.) to compare materials and view the results in a dynamically updating chart.
- **Responsive and User-Friendly UI**: A clean, responsive design ensures that the dashboard is accessible on multiple devices and screen sizes.
- **Filter Options**: Choose specific properties to filter and compare materials, making the dashboard customizable to the user's needs.
- **Sticky Navigation and Footer**: Navigation bar and footer remain accessible at the top and bottom of the screen, respectively, for easy access to other pages (e.g., Home, About, Contact Us).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application and dashboard components.
- **CSS**: Styling for layout, navbar, footer, and other visual elements.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality to interact with the chart and update content dynamically.
- **Chart.js**: JavaScript library used for creating interactive charts.
  
## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the structure of the dashboard.
- **style.css**: CSS file that styles the dashboard, navbar, footer, and other elements.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file that manages chart updates and filters based on user selections.
- **assets/**: Folder containing background images, icons, and other visual assets.
